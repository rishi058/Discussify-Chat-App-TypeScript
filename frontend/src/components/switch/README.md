How to use.

Copy these 3 files.
Install @radix-ui/react-switch.
Copy tailwind.config.js
Note :- for a div to inherit the animation you must add className(tailwind property) to the parent div and define something for light & dark.
Noe :- Make the div to cover atleast the whole-screen to make the animation look complete.
